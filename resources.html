<p><img src="http://insidehpc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pearl.jpg" style="float:right;width:150px;height;225px">
Pearl Hacks is a strictly women participant hackathon held at the UNC Chapel Hill campus. In 2015, it was held on Saturday, March 21st to Sunday, March 22nd.
Representatives from well-known companies--including Google, IBM, and others--set up booths that participants can access and ask questions and converse with the representatives.
Saturday features a collection of workshops throughout the afternoon to help those new to software and hardware learn the basics, and there are classes for those above the beginner range as well.
This hackathon gives participants those two days to design web sites, apps, other software, and hardware to compete for a variety of prizes, many of which are gifted by the sponsors.
It is a free event--food is free too--that shuttles students from colleges around the state, and it is very common for girls from outside the state to fly in.
The event also presents varying tech talks Saturday afternoon hosted by representatives and experts. Mentors are readily available at any time, and Pearl Hacks in general is a very friendly event.
